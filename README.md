# Rust Learning Journey

This repository contains my progress as I learn the Rust programming language. I am taking a project-based approach, building small applications to understand core concepts, syntax, and the Rust ecosystem.

## Projects

- **Hello Rust**: Basic introduction to Rust syntax and Cargo.
- **Temperature Converter**: A simple CLI tool to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius, focusing on user input and basic logic.

## Approach

Instead of just reading documentation, I am learning by doing. Each directory represents a specific day or project where I've implemented a functional piece of software to reinforce my learning.
